# Workshop-3-Collaborative-coding-version-control-introduction-to-Git-GitHub

This is an example repository for the ESMARConf2022 Workshop 3

* For the workshop you will need a GitHub account (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)

* You will also need to download R and RStudio (www.r-project.org; www.rstudio.com) 

There is a website (made in GitHub) [here](https://drmattg.github.io/Workshop-3-Collaborative-coding-version-control-introduction-to-Git-GitHub/) with some notes from the Workshop: 

During the workshop we aim to:

[] Understand the concept of version control 

[] Understand the basics of linking RStudio to GitHub

[] Understand committing changes in RStudio and pushing these to GitHub (and pulling changes down to the local machine)
[] Understand how to set up branches in RStudio
[] Understand pull requests
[] Understand tools for collaboration (issues, discussion, etc)

Throughout the workshop we will try and be as "hands-on" as possible and I expect that you all will be confident to have submitted an issue and sent a pull request by the end of the workshop.
